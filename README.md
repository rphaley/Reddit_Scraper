# Reddit_Scraper
This will scrape a given list of subreddits and parse out posts.  Provided a prompt, it will then utilize the OpenAI api to generate a response to the given post based on a preconfigured set of paramaters.  It will then email the user the original post along with the autogenerated response.

This deployment is currently for GCP and includes the following services:
 - Cloud Functions (used to run python code)
 - Cloud Scheduler (used to invoke code on a schedule)
 - Cloud Storage (used to maintain db of already viewed posts)
 - Secret Manager (used to store credentials for application)
